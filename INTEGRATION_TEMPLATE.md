## Industry Research Agent Example

### Scenario

Describe the specific implementation of the industry research agent for this platform:
1. How it queries the Company News Knowledge Graph
2. How it performs vector search
3. How multiple agents/components interact
4. Expected output

### Dataset Setup

**Company News Knowledge Graph (Read-Only Access):**
```language
# Platform-specific connection code
NEO4J_URI = "bolt://demo.neo4jlabs.com:7687"
NEO4J_USERNAME = "companies"
NEO4J_PASSWORD = "companies"
NEO4J_DATABASE = "companies"
```

**Data Model Reference:**
- Organizations with locations, industries
- Leadership (People → Organization)
- News articles with vector embeddings
- 250k entities from Diffbot Knowledge Graph

### Implementation

```language
# Full implementation example showing:
# 1. Setup and initialization
# 2. Define tools/functions for Neo4j access
# 3. Create agent(s)
# 4. Execute research workflow
# 5. Return synthesized results

# Include realistic, working code that demonstrates the integration
```
